# C Programming Lab Report (IOE)

This repository contains all lab codes for the C Programming course (Computer Engineering, IOE). It includes implementations of fundamental to advanced C programming concepts as required by the IOE syllabus.

## Overview

### Basic Programs:
- Hello World program
- Arithmetic operations
- Simple calculator
- Number swapping techniques

### Control Structures:
- Conditional statements (if-else, switch)
- Looping programs (for, while, do-while)
- Pattern generation programs
- Number series programs

### Functions and Recursion:
- Function implementations
- Recursive functions
- Factorial, Fibonacci series
- Tower of Hanoi

### Arrays and Pointers:
- 1D and 2D array operations
- Matrix operations
- Pointer arithmetic
- Dynamic memory allocation

### Structures and Files:
- Structure implementations
- File handling programs
- Database-like systems
- Student record systems

## Compilation and Execution

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - GCC compiler (MinGW for Windows)
   - Code::Blocks/Dev C++ (optional)

2. **Running the programs**:
   ```bash
   gcc filename.c -o output
   ./output

3. **Notes**
  -All programs are tested on GCC 9.3.0+
  -Programs follow IOE syllabus requirements
  -Contains comments for better understanding
  -Sample inputs/outputs included where necessary

4. **Contribution**
    Feel free to contribute by:
   -Reporting issues
   -Suggesting optimizations
   -Adding more examples
